<h1> Part One: Websites for Inspiration </h1>

<h3> 1. [The Mary Sue](https://www.themarysue.com) </h3>
<p>The layout of this website always makes me want to look at everything they have to offer. I like that they have a popular article ready-to-read right when you get on the website, and 5 article titles listed across the top as well. THEN as you read down the opening page, there are still more article previews along the side. Since the site has a focused audience (women ages 13 and up who enjoy geeky or academic subjects), each article preview does it's job of making me want to read. It's a common and simple feature, but the accompanying pictures really help. The color scheme and cartoony logo make the website feel personal and homey. Additionally, the top menu is convenient and easy to navigate, and the comments section below each article is accessible (easy to find and use). </p>

<h3> 2. [Dictionary.com](www.dictionary.com) </h3>
<p>I use this website so frequently, and it never disappoints me. The colors and graphics are simple and calming (the shades of blue and yellow they use are particulary uplifting). They use minimal links and menus, which keeps the site from being overwhelming. I like the word of the day on the opening page, it's always nice to learn a word when I go onto the site. I also like that though they have articles (which are very good), their presene is minimal. They are small links on the side, and are not previewed until you finish reading the main part of what you looked up.</p>

<h3> 3. [Gaby and Allison](https://www.gabyandallison.com) </h3>
<p>This is the website of two of my favorite comedians, Gaby Dunn and Allison Raskin. The site uses colors that I LOVE! It's rare to have such a bright background, text, and photos all at once, but it works so nicely here. This makes it fun and happy. The graphics are used well to create a strong personality for the site, being used only when needed in the perfect places. I like that the photos of Gaby and Allison on the homepage are all from the same shoot and look cohesive. Also, I like the layout of the top menu (it's something I might want to copy), and the way the blue text turns yellow for whatever page you're on.</p>

<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> My name is Hannah, and I just began a new journey of exploring Interactive Digital Media. I was previously an animation major, and while I still love animation, I was interested in pursuing a broader spectrum of knowledge and skills. I am just beginning my sophomore year at Drexel University, and basking in the charming nuances of Philadelphia college culture.</p>
<p> Currently, my biggest independent project is my new youtube channel, and the series I am working on, called Talking Walt. It is a new rendition of a blog I had 4 years ago, Babysitting Jack-Jack, and on it, I am watching every Disney animated film in order and reviewing them, with the help of a new guest each episode.</p>
<p>I do much more art as well. I play guitar and sing, and occasionally I write music. I am also working on improving my drawing and cartooning skills, and currently focusing on learning digital illustratoin. I minor in Computer Science, and code in Java and C++.</p>
<p>My side hobby is running a popular instagram for my dog, Phineas (@PhinasPuppy). He has tons of fans, and is an attractive, athletic, popular superstar. I gain such vicarious fufillment through that 16 lb fuzzwad. Other than him, my favorite things are the Harry Potter series, cookies, and rock n' roll. </p>
